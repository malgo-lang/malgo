import Malgo.Backend.OptMode

/-! Port of `src/Malgo/Backend/Zig/Toolchain.hs`: invokes the system `zig`
toolchain to turn generated Zig source into a native executable, for the
`malgo compile` subcommand.

Haskell shells out with `System.Process.readProcessWithExitCode`, but first
calls `findExecutable "zig"` and only attempts the spawn if that succeeds.
Lean uses `IO.Process.output`, which has no Lean-stdlib `findExecutable`
equivalent AND, unlike Haskell's `readProcessWithExitCode`, does not raise an
`IO.Error` when the command is missing — empirically (verified against this
binary) it instead returns `.ok` with a nonzero exit code and a `stderr` of
"could not execute external process 'zig'". Checking `PATH` up front with
`findOnPath` and never spawning at all when no `zig` is present avoids
depending on that message's exact text, and — critically — still lets a REAL
spawn/exit failure (a `zig` that IS on `PATH` but errors for some other
reason: permissions, a full cache-dir disk, a resource limit) fall through
to the generic "zig build-exe failed" branch with its own stderr intact,
rather than being misdiagnosed as "not installed".

`findOnPath` is a coarser check than Haskell's `findExecutable`: it only
confirms a file named `zig` exists on `PATH`, not that it is executable.
Lean's `IO.FS.Metadata` (v4.32.0) has no field exposing POSIX access rights
(`IO.setAccessRights` exists to set permissions, but there is no matching
getter) — checked directly against the pinned toolchain's source, not
assumed — so there is no portable way to check the execute bit from here. A
`zig` on `PATH` that exists but lacks the execute bit is therefore still
misreported as "found"; the resulting spawn failure surfaces as whatever
`IO.Process.output` produces for that case (see the `.error e` branch below),
not as the "not installed" message. -/
