## Steps
Follow **Review** â†’ **Implement**.

### Review
1. Fetch unresolved review comments for pull request `${pr_number}`:
   ```bash
   gh pr view ${pr_number} --comments
   ```
2. Ignore comments already marked as resolved.
3. Prioritize comments from core maintainers if multiple comments target the same line.
4. For each comment:
   - If no change is needed, reply via:
     ```bash
     gh pr comment ${pr_number} --body "AI response: <explanation>"
     ```
     explaining why no change is required.
   - If a change is required, group related comments and add to a TODO list.

### Implement
5. Execute each TODO item in order:
   - Apply the code changes.
   - Run project checks:
     ```bash
     mise run build
     mise run test
     ```
   - Repeat until checks pass.
6. Stage and commit changes for each group:
   ```bash
   git add -u
   git add <new-file>   # for any new files
   git commit -m "<short description of changes>"
   ```
7. Push the updates to the current branch:
   ```bash
   git push
   ```
