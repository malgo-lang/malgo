# ðŸš¦ TDD Pull Request Workflow (tâ€‘wada style)

## Context

- Repository: <REPO_URL>
- Issue: #<ISSUE_NUMBER> â€“ <ISSUE_TITLE>
- Goal: Resolve the above issue entirely via testâ€‘driven development.

## Global Rules

1. Follow Takuto Wadaâ€™s Outsideâ€‘In Leanâ€¯TDD (Red â†’ Green â†’ Refactor).
2. Babyâ€‘step cycles: â‰¤â€¯5â€¯minutes or â‰¤â€¯15â€¯LOC per cycle.
3. One git commit per cycle.
4. Commitâ€‘message conventions
   - Red : `Add failing test: <behaviour>`
   - Green: `Make test pass: <behaviour>`
   - Refactor only: `Refactor: <summary>`
5. Work on branch `feature/issue-<ISSUE_NUMBER>-<slug>`.

## Tasks for the Coding Agent

1. Read the issue body & linked discussion; extract acceptance criteria.
2. List all test scenarios (Givenâ€“Whenâ€“Then) in the PR description as a TODO list.
3. Write failing test(s) first.
4. Add minimal production code to go green.
5. Refactor for readability, duplication, and performance with all tests green.
6. Iterate until every acceptance criterion is satisfied.

## Git Workflow Skeleton

```bash
git switch -c feature/issue-<ISSUE_NUMBER>-<slug>

# --- Cycle N ---
# RED
# 1. write failing test
git add .
git commit -m "Add failing test: <behaviour>"

# GREEN
# 2. implement just enough code
git add .
git commit -m "Make test pass: <behaviour>"

# REFACTOR
# 3. improve design without changing behaviour
git add .
git commit -m "Refactor: <detail>"

# Push after each cycle (or every few cycles)
git push -u origin feature/issue-<ISSUE_NUMBER>-<slug>
```
