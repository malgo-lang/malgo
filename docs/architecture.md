# Malgo Interpreter Architecture

## 📁 Module Overview

Malgo’s source tree is organized by compiler phases and core abstractions:

- **Syntax & AST**:
  - `Malgo.Syntax`, `Malgo.Syntax.Extension`: Core AST types, phase-indexed with type families for extensibility.
- **Parsing**:
  - `Malgo.Parser`, `Malgo.Parser.Pass`: Lexing and parsing, producing the initial AST.
- **Renaming**:
  - `Malgo.Rename.Pass`, `Malgo.Rename.RnEnv`, `Malgo.Rename.RnState`: Name resolution and desugaring.
- **Type Inference**:
  - `Malgo.Infer.Pass`, `Malgo.Infer.TypeRep`, `Malgo.Infer.TcEnv`: Type checking, kind inference, and type environment management.
- **Refinement**:
  - `Malgo.Refine.Pass`, `Malgo.Refine.RefineEnv`: Cleans up and statically annotates the AST.
- **Intermediate Representations (IRs)**:
  - `Malgo.Sequent.Fun`, `Malgo.Sequent.Core.Full`, `Malgo.Sequent.Core.Flat`, `Malgo.Sequent.Core.Join`: Multiple IRs for lowering, optimization, and codegen.
- **Evaluation**:
  - `Malgo.Sequent.Eval`: Interpreter for the final IR.
- **Driver**:
  - `Malgo.Driver`: Orchestrates the full pipeline, from parsing to evaluation.
- **Pass Management**:
  - `Malgo.Pass`: Abstracts compiler passes for modularity and error handling.
- **Other**:
  - `Malgo.Interface`, `Malgo.Module`, `Malgo.Monad`, etc.: Module system, effectful monad stack, and project infrastructure.

**Pipeline Orchestration**:

`src/Malgo/Driver.hs` is the main entry point. It coordinates the pipeline as follows:

```
source file
   ↓
ParserPass → RenamePass → [InferPass] → [RefinePass]
   ↓           ↓             ↓             ↓
 AST    →  Renamed AST  → [Typed AST] → [Refined AST]
   ↓
ToFunPass → ToCorePass → FlatPass → JoinPass
   ↓           ↓           ↓         ↓
 Fun IR  →  Core IR   → Flat IR → Join IR
   ↓
EvalPass (Interpreter)
```

**Note**: InferPass and RefinePass (shown in brackets) can be skipped for evaluation purposes. The ToFunPass can operate directly on the renamed AST, allowing for faster compilation when type checking is not required.

## 🔄 Evaluation Pipeline and IR Flow

### Step-by-Step Transformation

1. **Parsing** (`ParserPass`):

   - Reads source code, produces a phase-indexed AST (`Module (Malgo NewParse)`).

2. **Renaming** (`RenamePass`):

   - Resolves names, desugars, produces `Module (Malgo Rename)`.

3. **Type Inference** (`InferPass`) - _Optional for evaluation_:

   - Infers types/kinds, annotates AST, produces `Module (Malgo Infer)`.
   - Can be skipped when type safety guarantees are not required for evaluation.

4. **Refinement** (`RefinePass`) - _Optional for evaluation_:

   - Cleans up AST, removes syntactic sugar, produces `Module (Malgo Refine)`.
   - Can be skipped when evaluation can work directly with the renamed AST.

5. **IR Lowering**:

   - **ToFunPass**: Lowers AST to a functional IR (`Sequent.Fun.Program`). Can operate on either refined AST (after RefinePass) or directly on renamed AST (skipping InferPass and RefinePass).
   - **ToCorePass**: Converts Fun IR to a sequent-style Core IR (`Sequent.Core.Full.Program`).
   - **FlatPass**: Flattens Core IR, removing nested computations (`Sequent.Core.Flat.Program`).
   - **JoinPass**: Normalizes control flow, producing the final IR (`Sequent.Core.Join.Program`).

6. **Evaluation** (`EvalPass`):
   - Interprets the final Join IR (`Sequent.Core.Join.Program`).

### Optional Type Checking and Refinement

The Malgo compiler supports two compilation modes:

**Full Pipeline Mode** (with type checking):

```
Parse → Rename → Infer → Refine → ToFun → ToCore → Flat → Join → Eval
```

**Fast Evaluation Mode** (skipping type checking):

```
Parse → Rename → ToFun → ToCore → Flat → Join → Eval
```

**When to Skip Type Checking:**

- **Rapid prototyping**: Quick evaluation without type safety guarantees
- **Trusted code**: When the code is known to be type-correct
- **Performance**: Faster compilation when type checking overhead is not desired
- **Testing**: Evaluating intermediate representations directly

**Implications of Skipping Type Checking:**

- **No type safety**: Runtime errors may occur for type mismatches
- **Faster compilation**: Eliminates type inference and constraint solving overhead
- **Direct AST lowering**: ToFunPass operates directly on `Module (Malgo Rename)` instead of `Module (Malgo Refine)`

### IRs in Detail

| IR Stage       | Defined In             | Purpose / Abstraction                | Structure-Preserving? | Phase Role            |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| Fun IR         | `Sequent/Fun.hs`       | Functional, simple, close to AST     | Mostly                | Initial lowering      |
| Core IR (Full) | `Sequent/Core/Full.hs` | Sequent calculus, explicit control   | Partially             | Pre-optimization      |
| Flat IR        | `Sequent/Core/Flat.hs` | No nested computations, flat control | Lossy (flattens)      | Simplifies codegen    |
| Join IR        | `Sequent/Core/Join.hs` | Normalized, explicit join points     | Lossy                 | Final, for evaluation |

- **Transformations** are mostly structure-preserving until flattening and joinification, which introduce explicit control flow and may lose some high-level structure.
- Each IR is tied to a phase: optimization, analysis, or interpretation.

## 📦 Intermediate Representation Design

- **Type Annotations**:
  - Typed ASTs and IRs carry type information, especially after inference.
- **Functional & Effect Modeling**:
  - IRs are purely functional; effects are modeled in the interpreter, not the IR.
- **Typeclasses**:
  - `Pretty`, `ToSExpr`, and others for pretty-printing, serialization, and lowering.
- **Polymorphism**:
  - Parametric types and fixpoint encodings are used for extensibility.
- **Variable Binding**:
  - Named binders (`Id`, `Name`), not De Bruijn indices.

**Example: IR Definition (simplified)**

```haskell
-- From Malgo.Sequent.Core.Join
data Producer where
  Var      :: Range -> Name -> Producer
  Literal  :: Range -> Literal -> Producer
  Lambda   :: Range -> [Name] -> Statement -> Producer
  -- ...

data Statement where
  Cut :: Producer -> Name -> Statement
  Join :: Range -> Name -> Consumer -> Statement -> Statement
  -- ...
```

## 🧠 Language Semantics and Evaluation

- **Semantics**:
  - Statically typed, functional language with first-class functions, pattern matching, and algebraic data types.
- **Evaluation**:
  - IR-based, not direct AST-walking.
  - Big-step semantics over the Join IR (`Sequent.Core.Join.Program`).
  - Tail-call optimization and closures are supported.
- **Interpreter**:
  - `Malgo.Sequent.Eval` implements the interpreter, using an explicit environment and handler abstraction.

---

## 🛠️ Extensibility and Implementation Notes

- **Adding Syntax/Semantics**:
  - Extend the AST and add new passes or extend existing ones.
- **Adding IR Stages**:
  - Implement new passes using the `Pass` typeclass and plug into the pipeline.
- **Backends**:
  - The modular IR pipeline allows for alternative backends (e.g., codegen, REPL).
- **Modularity**:
  - Each phase is isolated in its own module, with clear input/output types.
  - Pure logic (e.g., transformations) is separated from impure logic (e.g., IO, diagnostics).

---

## 🔗 Composition and Effects

- **Monad Stack**:
  - Uses `Effectful` for effect management:
    - `ReaderT` for configuration and environments
    - `StateT` for unique supply, type environments, etc.
    - `ExceptT` for error handling
    - `IOE` for IO boundaries
- **Custom Monads**:
  - Each pass can specify its own effect constraints.
- **Testability**:
  - Property-based and golden tests for each phase and IR transformation.
  - Staged testing: e.g., `test/Malgo/Sequent/ToCoreSpec.hs`, `EvalSpec.hs`.

---

## 💡 Advanced Topics

- **Template Haskell**:
  - Used for deriving instances and boilerplate (e.g., in `Syntax`).
- **Type-Level Programming**:
  - Type families and DataKinds for phase-indexing and IR invariants.
- **Debugging & Visualization**:
  - Pretty-printing via `Prettyprinter`, S-expression output via `ToSExpr`.
  - Dumps at each phase (see `withDump` in `Driver.hs`).
  - DOT graph output possible for IR visualization.
